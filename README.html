<h1>Muffin (An Umbraco Foundation)</h1>

<p>Muffin is a simplefied templating API / facade on top of the
Umbraco framework to allow easier front-end development, quicker development. It also comes with some helpers and default implementations of frequently used functionality.
It tries to focus SOLID principles as much as possible to allow better testability. A summary of what we try to achieve:<br />

<h3>Underconstruction:</h3>

<p>The whole foundation is constantly under development. </p>

<p>Like to know what we are working on right now, see our <a href="https://trello.com/b/YMtpIdMT/muffin-development">Trello Board</a></p>

<p>Currently build on top of Umbraco 7.2.4</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Umbraco is installed and updated via Nuget.  </li>
<li>The models generator currently relies on uSync which is also installed and updated via Nuget.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples and documentation</h2>

<ul>
<li>The example database username is "admin" and the password is "password".  </li>
<li>The nuget package and the example project both use Autofac. See the implementation folder for more information and / or customization. </li>
