<h1>Muffin (An Umbraco Foundation)</h1>

<p>Muffin is the reincarnation of the foundation formerly known as the Macaw Umbraco Foundation. It's a simplefied templating API / facade on top of the
Umbraco framework to allow easier front-end development, quicker development. It also comes with some helpers and default implementations of frequently used functionality.
It tries to focus SOLID principles as much as possible to allow better testability. For more info you can als find a presentation given at the BUUG:
